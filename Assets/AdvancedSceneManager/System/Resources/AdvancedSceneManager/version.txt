2.1
Features:
- Rewritten In-game toolbar.
- New scene dropdowns for when only specific scenes may be selected, like loading screens.
- Added Collections Overlay, and overlay / widget for scene view to easily see what collections are associated with the currently opened scenes, and provide an easy way to open / close them.
- Added support for PlayMaker with some ASM actions.
- Added SceneOperation.With(Progress<T>) to provide custom progress in addition to normal progress tracking.
- Added option to automatically open standalone scene when entering play mode using unity play button.
- Added SceneManager.runtime.scenePreloaded event.
- Added Scene.Preload(Action onPreloaded) parameter.
- Added SceneManager.CloseAll(params Scene[] except) parameter.
- Added support for setting active collection scene to null.
- Added undo to scene split (scene merge coming later).

Compatibility:
- Support for 2023.
- Support for 2021.
- ASM legacy introduced, this provides a streamlined patching experience for people stuck on 1.9, and a better exprerience upgrading from 1.9 to 2.x. This mode will be automatically toggled on if running on an unsupported version of unity (2020 and below), or if project contains assets from 1.9.

Bugs:
- Fixed duplicate drag drop operations issue that would sometimes occur when attempting to drag a collection.
- Fixed issue where fallback scene would throw error when ASM folder moved.
- Fixed some bugs with additive scenes.
- Fixed an issue with DiscardPreload().
- Fixed bugged scroll in overview popup.
- Fixed collection separator sometimes not centered.
- Fixed splash screen playing on restart.
- Fixed issue with DontDestroyOnLoad scene detection causing error on exit play mode due to adding helper object during exit.
- Fixed update check refering to wrong url.
- Fixed issue with version string.
- Fixed issue with dynamic collection scenes having hidden object field.
- Fixed issue with local documentation button in menu popup.
- When entering playmode with ASM play button, Start() and similar would get called on currently opened scene, before closing. This has been fixed.
- Fixed issue where standalone scene options would not save.
- Fixed null reference in SceneBindingUtility.
- Fixed popup overlay container having a background, underneath actual popup background, it would become visible when resizing window horizontally, when popup width would reach max size.
- Fixed issue where ObjectFieldDisplay on scene fields would become blue after drag and drop.
- Added save prompt before playing.
- Fixed cross-scene references window style not found.
- Fixed missing xml documentation for a couple of methods on Scene.
- Fixed a null ref in SceneOperation.progress when called too early.
- Fixed issue where yielding SceneOperation would sometimes return immediately, due to bad CustomYieldInstruction.keepWaiting implementation.
- Scene dropdown for active collection scene would display none, which is not actually supported.
- Fixed an issue where creating a collection, then immedietly renaming it would result in profile being renamed instead.
- Changed patch notes to a debug log instead of update button tooltip.
- Fixed update button not working.
- Fixed issue with EditorSceneManager not unregistering a listener that is only supposed to be run outside of play mode, when configurable play mode is not enabled, causing all collection loading screens to be disabled in editor. 

Misc:
- Opening scenes from ISceneOpenAsync would cause current operation to continue and not wait for this new operation. Support has been added for this, and first operation will now wait for that new operation.
- Made scene bindings sections in settings always be displayed, and just disable sections when input system is not installed.
- Added better handling of un-included scenes, ASM will now add the scene to standalone when it cannot be opened, allowing user to just restart play mode, as they see the warning.
- Made toolbar play buttons a lot nicer.
